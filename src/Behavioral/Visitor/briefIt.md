The Visitor design pattern is a way to separate algorithms from the objects they operate on. It allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those objects. Here's a simplified explanation:\
**How the Visitor Pattern Works**
- You have a hierarchy of objects (e.g., different shapes like Circle, Square, Triangle) that need to support various operations (e.g., calculating area, drawing, etc.).
- Instead of putting the operation logic inside each shape class, you create a separate Visitor interface with a visit method for each shape type.
- Each shape class implements an accept method that takes a Visitor object as an argument. When called, this method delegates the operation to the corresponding visit method on the Visitor object, passing itself as an argument.
- To perform an operation, you create a concrete Visitor class that implements the Visitor interface and defines the operation logic in the respective visit methods.
- You then create a Visitor object and pass it to the accept method of each shape object you want to operate on.
- **Structure**

- Use the Visitor when you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
- Use the Visitor to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
- Use the pattern when a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.
- Promotes Single Responsibility, Open/Closed and Interface Segregation principles.
