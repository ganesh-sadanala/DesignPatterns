If the Command pattern is not used, a common approach is to directly invoke methods on the receiver objects from the client or invoker. Let's explore the problems with this approach and how the Command pattern solves them.

Implementation without Command Pattern:

class Editor {
public void copy() {
// Perform copy operation
}

    public void cut() {
        // Perform cut operation
    }

    public void paste() {
        // Perform paste operation
    }
}

class Application {
private Editor editor;

    public Application(Editor editor) {
        this.editor = editor;
    }

    public void copyOperation() {
        editor.copy();
    }

    public void cutOperation() {
        editor.cut();
    }

    public void pasteOperation() {
        editor.paste();
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Editor editor = new Editor();
Application app = new Application(editor);

        app.copyOperation();
        app.cutOperation();
        app.pasteOperation();
    }
}
Problems with this implementation:

Tight Coupling: The Application class is tightly coupled to the Editor class. It directly invokes methods on the Editor object, which means any changes to the Editor class may require changes in the Application class as well.
Lack of Flexibility: If new operations need to be added or existing operations need to be modified, it requires changes to both the Editor and Application classes. This violates the Open-Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
No Support for Undo/Redo: With this implementation, it is difficult to support undoable operations. There is no mechanism to store the state before executing an operation and no way to revert the changes.
Limited Parameterization: The Application class is hardcoded to work with specific operations (copy(), cut(), paste()). It cannot be easily parameterized with different operations or dynamically change the behavior at runtime.
Now, let's see how the Command pattern solves these problems:

Loose Coupling: The Command pattern introduces a command interface that decouples the invoker (Application) from the receiver (Editor). The invoker works with the command interface, without knowing the specific details of the receiver.
Flexibility and Extensibility: New commands can be easily added by creating new concrete command classes that implement the command interface. The existing code in the invoker and receiver remains unchanged. This adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.
Support for Undo/Redo: The Command pattern allows for the implementation of undoable operations. Each command object can store the necessary state before executing the operation and provide an undo() method to revert the changes. The executed commands can be stored in a stack, enabling undo/redo functionality.
Parameterization: The invoker can be parameterized with different command objects. It can work with any object that implements the command interface, allowing for dynamic behavior and runtime flexibility.
