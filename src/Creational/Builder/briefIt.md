- Complex objects are built step by step.
- Eliminates Mota(Fat) constructors.
- Usage of Single Responsibility Principle.
- The Creational.Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called **builders**.

- Use the Creational.Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
- Use the Creational.Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
- Use the Creational.Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).
